Commit Document: Updates to encrypt.ts for Key Handling and Fallback Mechanism

Commit 1: feat: Add support for fallback encryption key and warning for missing key

Explanation:
	•	Problem addressed: The initial implementation relied on an environment variable ENCRYPTION_KEY being present. If it was missing, it could result in a runtime error when the encryption function was executed.
	•	Solution implemented: A fallback mechanism was added to handle cases where the ENCRYPTION_KEY is missing or undefined. If the key is not set in the environment variables, a default key ('default-secret-key') is used.
	•	Impact: This ensures that encryption can still be performed even when the key is missing, particularly helpful for local development and testing environments.
	•	Logging: A console warning is generated if the key is not provided, alerting developers about this issue.

Commit 2: fix: Adjust hash function to handle missing or empty encryption key gracefully

Explanation:
	•	Problem addressed: When the ENCRYPTION_KEY is missing or invalid, the hashing function would fail due to attempts to create a cryptoKey using an empty or undefined key.
	•	Solution implemented: The hash function was updated to check if the ENCRYPTION_KEY is available in the environment variables. If it’s missing, the function defaults to using a fallback key ('default-secret-key').
	•	Impact: The function no longer throws errors when the key is not available. Instead, it ensures that hashing continues using the fallback key, preventing failures due to key issues.
	•	Fallback key: The fallback key ensures that hashing operations can still proceed, but it’s essential for developers to securely manage their encryption keys in production.

Commit 3: chore: Add logging for missing encryption key in development

Explanation:
	•	Problem addressed: Developers could be unaware that they were using the default encryption key, which might not be secure for production environments.
	•	Solution implemented: A console.warn log was added when the ENCRYPTION_KEY is not available. This warning reminds developers to provide a valid encryption key for secure operations, particularly in production.
	•	Impact: It provides better transparency during development and testing, ensuring developers are aware of potential key management issues.

Commit 4: docs: Update comments and security considerations in encrypt.ts

Explanation:
	•	Problem addressed: Lack of clear documentation explaining the changes, especially the fallback mechanism and its implications for security.
	•	Solution implemented: Updated the comments in the encrypt.ts file to clarify how the fallback key is used and explain the security implications of using it in development versus production.
	•	Security consideration: Developers are reminded not to use the fallback key ('default-secret-key') in production environments and to securely handle and store the actual encryption key.
	•	Impact: Improved readability of the code and provided important security considerations for developers working with the file.

Summary:

These updates to the encrypt.ts file introduce better error handling and fallback mechanisms when the encryption key is missing or empty. The solution ensures the application doesn’t break during development or testing due to missing environment variables. At the same time, warnings are introduced to alert developers of potential security risks associated with using default encryption keys. This change improves the robustness of the encryption functionality and emphasizes the importance of securing sensitive keys in production.
